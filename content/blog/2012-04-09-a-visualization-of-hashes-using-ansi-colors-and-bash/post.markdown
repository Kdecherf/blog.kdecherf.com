Two weeks ago, [@waxzce](https://twitter.com/waxzce) found a [tool](https://github.com/bengl/node-hashcolors) to colorize hashes using ANSI colors and Node.js.


Personally, my laptop doesn't have Node.js installed so I wanted to remake this tool using a widely used language: Bash.


It's a tiny script that supports multiple arguments, files and strings.

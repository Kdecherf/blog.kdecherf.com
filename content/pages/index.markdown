I am a system engineer and developer living in France. Computers are my passion since the high school when I started developing websites on my spare time. Following the exploration of new languages like _C#_ I joined the Microsoft's community as a student partner for few years. I truly discovered the Linux world at the same time and sharing the two worlds was an interesting experiment. I eventually focused on the latter as a trainer and full-time system engineer. The use of a wide range of languages and technologies is my everyday challenge, so are production and monitoring topics in general.

Knoppix, Mandrake, Gentoo and others remind me funny memories of the old time but now I contribute to [Exherbo](http://exherbo.org), a great and fresh source-based distribution. I've co-founded [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com), a french awesome cloud platform, where I am the production manager. You can checkout my profile on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kdecherf) and [LinkedIn](https://linked.com/in/kdecherf).

My spare time lets me enjoy my other passions like photography, books and Japanese culture to name a few. I share photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kdecherf), thoughts and links on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kdecherf) and sometimes anecdotes about sysadmin on [*Le Kdecherf](http://le.kdecherf.com).

You can reach me by email at _kevin @ kdecherf.com_ —and don't hesitate to use my GPG key `0x108ABD75A81E6E2F` (which can be found [here](https://kdecherf.com/kdecherf.asc)) if you need privacy— or by using the old-school but still famous IRC protocol on the networks [Freenode](http://freenode.org) and [Geeknode](http://www.geeknode.org).
